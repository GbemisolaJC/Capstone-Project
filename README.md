## Sales Performance Analysis

1. I started by using Excel to clean my data by removing duplicates using all columns as criteria.

2. Afterwards, I proceeded to calculate total sales (quantity * unit price).

3. Next, I created a summary table to analyze sales performance by category, product,region, using functions like `SUM` and `AVERAGE` to derive insights.
